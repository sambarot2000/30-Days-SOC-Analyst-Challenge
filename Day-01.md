## âš¡ Key Tasks Completed
- Planned SOC lab environment including:
  - Endpoints: Windows & Linux
  - Fleet Servers
  - Ticketing & C2 Servers
  - Network Components (VPC, Internet Gateway)
- Created a **clear logical diagram** of log flow
- Identified **tools for upcoming exercises**:
  - ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
  - Beats agents (Winlogbeat, Filebeat)
  - OS Ticketing system
  - Attack/Detection VMs

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Outcome
- Visual roadmap of SOC lab
- Ready reference for lab setup and configuration
- Clear view of log collection, alerting, and ticketing flow
